== DESCRIPTION:

scbi_fqbin is a gem to handle compressed fastq and fasta files (FQbin files) made by Rafael Larrosa, Gonzalo Claros & Dario Guerrero for the Plataforma Andaluza de Bioinform√°tica.

FastaBin was developed to handle huge fasta and qual files in a more efficient manner. To achieve its goals, FastaBin uses some 
indexing and compression techniques in order to minimize disk accesses and thus increase the performance when reading fasta and qual files.
