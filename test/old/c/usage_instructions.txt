Manual of the YAGFF (Yet Another Genetic File Format)
OGF (Optimized Genetic Format)


First a call to :
        error=initialize_writes(outname,1);

Is needed to initialize the files.

Its arguments are:

- the name of the main output file and to this the suffix .index will be
  appended for the index file.

- The mode of the write:
	1 : create a new file
	2 : append data to already existing files

It returns 
	 0 if everything goes fine, 
	-1 if there is a problem with already existing files, like an incorrect
		version number 
	-2 if there is a problem creating or opening files

In case of error it writes it on stderr


Then request to write can be done:

int error_wr=write_seq(sname, fasta,qual,extras);

Where sname is a char* with the name of the sequence, and fasta, qual and
extras are char* with the fasta, qual and extras data.

At the end a call to : closes_writes();
is needed to close the opened files



The reads are even easier:

int read_seq(char *filename, char *seq_name, char **fasta, char **qual, char **extras)
The arguments are:
filename: is a char* used as input the name of the main file, .index is appended for the index file
seq_name :  char* that contains the name of the searched sequence

And the result are returned in :
fasta, qual and extras, if they point to NULL they are malloced to bufsize=150000 bytes (defined inside the function)
else they are used without checking its size



For doing sequential reads an untested procedure is implemented:

int initialize_sequential_reads(char *filename);

// return -9 on EOF
int read_data_sequential(char **seq_name, char **fasta, char **qual, char **extras)
int close_sequential_reads();
